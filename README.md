This is Django REST API Integration to send whatsApp Message and also provide response when new user is any product is uploaded and existing user is upload product it will automatically send whatsApp text messsage.
I used signal to send message user or product is uploaded.
For API_key and Base_URL, create app and developer tools API section in https://www.infobip.com/
Also we generate integrate urls and key from https://developers.meta.com/ to access it.
I integrate this api endpoints for Testing purpose not production.
